Verbose - Rooms that have not been entered by the player will display a room description upon entry. Once the player 
re-enters a room, the room description will no longer be displayed. If the player forgets or wants to see the room description
again, the player can type "verbose on" and the room description will always be displayed for every room. If the player no longer wants
to see the room description, they can type "verbose off" and the room description will be removed.

Locked Doors - Some rooms contain exits which barr entry to the player, unless they obtain the necessary item, known as
a key, to open it. Each exit has its own unique key, which is located somewhere in the dungeon. To encounter a locked door,
go to the () room (located () from the entry), whose() exit, called (), is listed in the room description as closed.
If you attempt to go through the exit, you will be informed that the door is locked. Go to the () room, located () from the
() room. Take the () key contained there. Return to the () room, and attempt to open the door with the () key by typing
"unlock () door with ()" or "open () door with ()"." The game will inform you that you can't use the key to open the door.
If you attempt to go () again, you will discover that the door is still locked. The exit's true key is found in the
() room, located () from the () room. Return to the room with the locked door and type "unlock () door with ()" or "open
() door with ()". The game will inform you that you have unlocked the exit, allowing you to advance () into the () room.

Hunger - In addition to healing wounds, the player must also maintain their hunger throughout their adventure. Each
time the player enters a valid command (take, drop, move, unlock or item/character specific), their hunger increases by one point. Hunger is
assessed through three thresholds: minor (between 1 and 50 valid turns), moderate (between 51 and 100 valid turns) and
critical (between 101 and 150 valid turns). Once a player passes each threshold, they are warned once. To test the hunger
feature, waste time in the dungeon performing valid commands. After the 51st turn, the program will state "Your stomach growls ferociously."
To alleviate your hunger, go to the () room (located () from the entry), which contains a (). Eat the () by typing "eat ()". The
game will say "(). You are full." Note that if you eat a light snack, then your hunger may not appreciably change.
For example, waste time performing valid commands until the game informs you that your stomach grows ferociously. Then, head
to the () room, located () from the entry. It contains a (), which only detracts () points from your health. If you
eat it, then hunger does not lower below the minor threshold, and the game still informs you that your stomach is not fully satisfied.
Continue to move through the dungeon, allowing your hunger to increase to the critical level. Do not eat any food. Do not visit the () room,
located () from the entry, since you will be killed by the AutoKiller NPCs contained there. After 151 turns, you will collapse from exhaustion and
die from starvation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fatigue - Just as the player's hunger grows after every turn, so too does their fatigue. Each time the player enters a
valid command (take, drop, move, unlock or item/character specific), their hunger increases based on the weight of the
adventurer's inventory. If the player is empty handed, then fatigue increases by one point. However, if the adventurer
is carrying items, then an extra twentieth of the player's inventory weight is added, plus the default one point. Like hunger, fatigue is
assessed through three thresholds: minor (between 1 and 50 valid turns), moderate (between 51 and 100 valid turns) and
critical (between 101 and 150 valid turns). Once a player passes each threshold, they are warned once. To test the fatigue
feature, waste time in the dungeon performing valid commands. Make sure to place items into your inventory to increase
the rate of your fatigue. You can take the (), () and () located in the () room, () of the entry. After reaching the
moderate threshold, the program will state "Your eyes droop from fatigue." Type "health" to see the state of your hunger.
To alleviate your exhaustion, type "sleep." The game will inform you of the state of your health after your nap. Since the
sleep command transfers the current level of fatigue to hunger, you will find that your hunger has increased. Restart the game and move through
the dungeon, allowing your fatigue to increase to the critical level. Do not sleep or eat. After 151 turns, the game will inform
you that you have collapsed from fatigue and fallen asleep on the spot. Since you have neglected your hunger, your nap will have
caused you to die from starvation.
