Verbose- Rooms that have not been entered by the player will display a room description upon entry. Once the player 
         re-enters a room, the room description will no longer be displayed. If the player forgets or wants the see 
	 the room description again, the player can type "verbose on" and the room description will be displayed. If 
         the player no longer wants to see the room description, they can type "verbose off" and the room description
	 will be removed.
